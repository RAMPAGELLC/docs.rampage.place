# Moderator Policies

## Introduction

Our main goals here at the Moderation Branch are to keep all players safe and to make sure our rules are followed by all players and moderators. These guidelines have been made due to most of our moderators abusing some of their powers.

If there is still confusion or you just do not understand something, please do not be afraid to contact a more experienced staff member and ask for help, do not violate Chian of Command. We are very happy to help you because of course you can not know everything, everyone started from the beginning.

Just because you are staff doesn’t mean you don’t have to follow the rules. Staff violating rules severely will result in a demotion + staff blacklist + temp ban (or even a perm ban) at staff supervisor discretion.

You cannot moderate other staff members, only staff supervisors. Exception for a staff member mass abusing (false bans, false demotions, etc). If you have to moderate another staff member for mass-abuse issue a 78-hour ban and contact a staff supervisor immediately.
