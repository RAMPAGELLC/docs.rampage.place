# Developer Orientation

## Introduction

Welcome to the Development Branch. This page goes over briefly our branch.

The development branch provides high-quality asset(s) to the company, in order to advance the collection of games and sites owned by RAMPAGE Interactive.

Developers may receive some form of compensation via Robux, USD, Crypto, etc. This is usually agreed on prior to working on asset(s).

Upon completion of the asset(s) may be used on RAMPAGE Interactive-owned game(s) and/or website(s). It's important that our engineers understand that if an asset is created for RAMPAGE Interactive and you are compensated it will become the sole property of the company and you mustn't use the asset in any other experience, website, re-distribute, etc.

Each task(s) is considered commission-based work. Compensation is paid after work completion.

## Junior Developer Restrictions

Junior Developers must complete a probationary period before becoming a full members of our development branch. There is no specific time frame assigned to it and is at the discretion of the Branch Coordinator.

Junior Developers may be called Juniors, however, they are not new to development. They are simply new to this specific development team.

Junior Developers will have the inability to;

* Access company GitHub repositories.
* Development Branch role on RAMPAGE Interactive LLC Roblox Group. They will only have an Employee role until the probationary period is over.
* Inability to request certain asset(s).

## How do I start working as a Junior?

Tasks will become available on our Development Branch-specific Project Trello you were assigned to. Upon completing tasks you gain the trust of the company and your fellow peers.

You cannot auto-take a task on Trello as a Junior Developer. Tasks must be manually assigned to you by a Branch Supervisor or Branch Coordinator.

After completing a satisfactory amount of tasks the Branch Coordinators will come to a decision on whether to appoint you as a full team member.
