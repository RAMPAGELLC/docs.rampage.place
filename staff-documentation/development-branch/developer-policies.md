# Developer Policies

## Programming Team

* The code should be efficient and optimized.
* Never trust the client.
* Heavily test projects prior to submitting.
* Minimize usage of lops.
* Clean & Readable code is a requirement.
* Don't make something stupidly long.

## 3D Modelling

* No free/downloaded models from the internet.
* Unnecessary triangles/faces in your model.
* No easter eggs such as writing your name in the vertices of your model.
* Must be similar to the relevant project's current style.
* Your modifications are applied to your model.
* Your model is under 10k triangles or exported as a .fdx.

## Architectural Team

* Conform to the project's current style.
* No excess / unneeded unions, textures, etc.
* Ensure unions do not create any weird bugs, collision issues, etc.
* No easter eggs unless approved by Team Supervisor.

## Payment

Payment is based on the complexity of a project, asset(s) quality, and time spent.
