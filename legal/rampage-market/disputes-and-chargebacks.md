# Disputes and Chargebacks



## What are Disputes and Chargebacks? <a href="#h_b143e80bec" id="h_b143e80bec"></a>

A dispute, or chargeback, happens when a customer challenges a transaction. Common reasons include not receiving an item, receiving a damaged or incorrect item, or unauthorized use of their payment method.

When a dispute is filed, the affected order is placed "On-Hold." (appearing as a indefinite Order Processing.)&#x20;

This means the transaction is paused, and funds cannot be withdrawn until the issue is resolved. We understand this can be frustrating, so we're here to guide you through every step of the process.

## Our Commitment to Vendors

During dispute proceedings, we will:

* Make every reasonable effort to contest disputes on your behalf.
* Bear the costs associated with the dispute resolution process as a gesture of goodwill, provided the vendor is not at fault.
* Notify vendors promptly of any dispute and provide clear instructions on any required actions or documentation.

## Resolution Process

The process for handling disputes is straightforward:

1. **Notification**: You'll receive an email detailing the dispute and next steps.
2. **Documentation**: We may require additional information or documentation from you to contest the dispute.
3. **Resolution**: We'll work with the payment service to resolve the dispute as quickly as possible. Orders will remain "On-Hold" until a resolution is reached.

## Outcome

* **If the dispute is resolved in the vendor's favor**: The order will be released from "On-Hold" status, and funds will become available for withdrawal.
* **If resolved in favor of the customer**: The order will not be eligible for withdrawal. In such cases, Clearly Development will still cover any dispute-related fees as a gesture of support, unless the vendor is found at fault.

## **Best Practices**

To minimize disputes, we recommend:

* Providing clear, accurate product descriptions.
* Ensuring product integrity on delivery of items.
* Maintaining open communication with customers.
