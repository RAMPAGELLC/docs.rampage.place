# Refund Policy

## Overview

Our goal is to maintain a fair and transparent marketplace for all users. Due to the nature of digital content, all product sales by vendors are typically final. However, we acknowledge that exceptions are necessary in certain situations. This guide outlines our product refund policy, explaining the circumstances under which refunds can be requested and how they will be processed.

## Refund Eligibility

We only provide refunds if the following criteria is met:

* Product does not function
* Wrong product delivered
* Product violates Term's of Service and/or Vendor Guidelines.
* Product infringes on the Intellectual property rights of another Individual/Business.
* Unauthorized usage of payment method

## How to request a refund

Customers must contact the vendor prior to contacting us. Vendors have 72 hours (3 days) to respond to a customer's concerns and attempt to resolve the issue, if its not resolved within 72 hours we will issue an refund.
