# Marketplace Submission Guideline

Our submission guidelines are crafted to support both new and established contributors in understanding our expectations when submitting products to our marketplace. To uphold a superior standard of quality, our review team meticulously evaluates all submissions against these criteria. If a product does not meet our standards, corrections based on feedback are required before resubmission. It's important to note that subsequent reviews may uncover additional issues, even after initial feedback is addressed.
