# Copyright Takedown

To process your claim effectively, we require the following information:

1. Your full contact details, including your name, postal address, and phone number.
2. A detailed account of the copyrighted material you believe has been infringed upon.
3. An explanation of the content on our platform that you allege infringes your copyright, with enough detail to enable us to identify and locate it. Providing direct web addresses (URLs) to the contentious content is the most efficient way to achieve this.
4. A statement asserting that:
   * You hold a bona fide belief that the use of the copyrighted content as outlined in your complaint is not sanctioned by the copyright owner, their agent, or the law.
   * The information presented in your notice is accurate.
   * Under the risk of perjury, you are the copyright holder or are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is purportedly infringed.
5. Either your electronic or physical signature.

Please note that we regularly provide your name, contact information, and the contents of your report to the person who posted the content you are reporting. If you are an authorized representative submitting a report, we provide the name of the organization or client that owns the right in question.&#x20;

For this reason, you may wish to provide a professional or business email address.

Please forward all takedowns to legal@rampagestudios.org.
