4. **Compliance with Laws**: Ensure your software complies with all applicable laws and regulations, including but not limited to copyright laws, privacy laws, and export restrictions.
5. **Customer Support**: Provide adequate customer support to assist users with installation, troubleshooting, and inquiries related to your software.
6. **Fair Pricing**: Set fair and competitive prices for your software products. Avoid misleading pricing strategies or hidden fees.
