# Term's of Service

**Effective Date:** October 12th, 2024.

## **Introduction**

Welcome to **META Link** (the "Registry"), a proprietary database owned by Metatable Games. META Link is designed to link Roblox accounts to Discord accounts for verification purposes. By accessing or using the Registry, you agree to comply with these Terms of Service (the "Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, you may not use the Registry.

## **1. User Eligibility**

You must be at least 13 years old to use the Registry. By linking your Roblox and Discord accounts, you represent that you meet this age requirement and that you are responsible for complying with all applicable laws and regulations.

## **2. Purpose of the Registry**

The Registry is used solely to verify Roblox and Discord account links for Metatable Games. This service is for authentication purposes within games that require verified accounts for gameplay or community management.

## **3. Account Linking**

By using META Link, you will be prompted to link your Roblox account to your Discord account. You may only link one Discord account to one Roblox account. Any attempt to link multiple accounts will be considered a violation of these Terms.

## **4. Unlinking and Data Deletion**

Upon linking, you will have the option to "Unlink" your accounts at any time. This action will permanently delete any and all records of your Roblox and Discord accounts from the Registry database. Once deleted, your information cannot be recovered, and you will need to relink your accounts to regain access to any game services requiring verification.

## **5. Prohibited Use**&#x20;

You agree not to:

* Use the Registry for any unlawful or fraudulent purposes.
* Attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or hack the Registry.
* Misrepresent your identity or provide false information during the linking process.

Metatable Games reserves the right to modify or update these Terms at any time without prior notice. Your continued use of the Registry following any such changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms.

## **7. Termination**
