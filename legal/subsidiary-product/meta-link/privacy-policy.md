# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** October 12th, 2024.

**Introduction**

This Privacy Policy explains how **META Link** (the "Registry") collects, uses, and protects your personal information when linking Roblox accounts to Discord accounts for verification purposes.

## **1. Information We Collect**&#x20;

The Registry collects the following information when you link your Roblox and Discord accounts:

* Your Roblox User ID
* Your Discord User ID

This data is used solely for the purpose of account verification within Metatable Games and is shared with third parties.

## **2. How We Use Your Information**&#x20;

The information collected is used to verify your Roblox and Discord accounts to ensure that you are a legitimate user within Metatable Games.

## **3. Data Storage**&#x20;

## **4. Unlinking and Data Deletion**

You may choose to unlink your Roblox and Discord accounts at any time through the Registry interface. When you unlink, all data related to your accounts will be permanently deleted from the Registry. This action is irreversible, and once deleted, the information cannot be recovered.

## **5. Data Security**

We take reasonable measures to protect the security of your personal information. However, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data.

## **6. Your Rights**

You have the right to:

* Access the personal information we hold about you.
* Request the permanent deletion of your data by using the "Unlink" feature.
