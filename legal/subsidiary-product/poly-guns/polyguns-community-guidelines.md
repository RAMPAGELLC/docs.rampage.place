# PolyGuns Community Guidelines

Thanks for being a player! Part of our commitment to fostering a safe and inclusive environment includes setting and enforcing a set of guidelines for our players to follow while playing on PolyGuns. These Community/Moderation Guidelines apply to all areas of PolyGuns, including the website, game, chat and interaction, the Forum, and public events hosted, etc by PolyGuns/RAMPAGE.

If you have not read our Terms of Service, those coincide with these Community Guidelines. To read our Terms of Service in full.

## Basics

We are a game targeted at a general audience. Some things just don't belong in that sphere. Our development and moderation team are hip youngsters and know all of the fancy lingo of this century, so please be appropriate with the content you upload, create, and post.\
\
Obviously this list is not all-inclusive because we cannot list every detail about what we expect. We ask that you use the "common sense rule" -- if you know it's wrong, we know it's wrong, and you could get suspended for it.\
\
(See Section "Consequences" below)

## Rules

**1. Be respectful.**\
Respect your fellow players. Treat them with kindness and try to see things from their perspective. If you can't come to a reasonable agreement after a disagreement, just walk away.\
\
**2. Do not try to bypass filtered text or content.**\
We have a profanity filter in place to sift through inappropriate content that never belongs (like discriminatory speech and adult content), however. Do not try to bypass this filter or you may be suspended permanently.\
\
Additionally, usernames, display names, etc are not allowed to have any profanity. These areas of our website are filtered more heavily than general content.\
\
**3. Do not post unapproved links.**\
We cannot verify the security of external links, therefore we choose not to allow them. The only **approved websites** to link to are rampage.place/rampage.host/rampagestudios.org, epicgames.com, steam.com/steamcommunity.com/steampowered.com, discord.com/discordapp.com, reddit.com, twitter.com/x.com, youtube.com/youtu.be, and it's subdomain(s).&#x20;

Our moderation team will visit approved links posted from time to time to ensure the content posted doesn't violate our rules.\
\
**4. Do not share personal information about yourself or others.**\
This rule includes asking for personal information -- that is also not allowed. Personal information like an address, email address, real life name, birthday, credit card number, password(s), social security number, and others should not be shared with others or asked for.\
\
**5. Do not bully or harass others.**\
You may not bully or harass others, for any reason, at any time. Respect is our #1 rule. This includes sexual harassment or advances made towards others. Bullying or harassing others in any manner will result in a permanent suspension.\
\
**6. Don't pretend you are someone you are not.**\
We know you aren't a billboard top 100 rapper, but someone else may not. Please do not impersonate anyone that you aren't, including our employees, celebrities, politicians, the government, police, etc.\
\
**7. No dating or relationship seeking.**\
We are not a dating website, and those types of conversations often end up being against some of our previous guidelines. Please don't seek or participate in any dating here.\
\
**8. No threats, towards others or us.**\
We respect our players, their opinions, and their feedback. We understand sometimes it comes with criticism. The same goes with players who have differing opinions. Please do not threaten to harm others, or us, about anything at any time.&#x20;

All website activity is monitored and stored for safety purposes, but we don't want to use it to tackle an issue that can be avoided.

No exploiting/hacking systems on the website, game, launcher, etc. All bugs must be reported to bugs team at admin@rampagestudios.org.

## Consequences

Players that violate these Community Guidelines may be suspended. Suspensions are serious, and they go against your record as a player. No suspension is alike -- our team determines the length of each suspension on a case by case basis.

## Our Team

Administrators and moderators are excluded from these Community Guidelines because they are governed by separate policies enacted for employees. Their actions are also reviewed by managers to ensure they are following their own set of rules.\
\
Our employees use external services to access certain features they use for safety purposes. Never assume a specific moderator suspended an account, sometimes they are lurking in the shadows.\
\
Admins and moderators have the final say in all account suspensions. Per our Terms of Service, players may be suspended at any time for any reason.

No refunds for moderation action taken against your account.
