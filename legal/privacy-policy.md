## Privacy Policy

Effective as of the January 4th, 2022

We care a lot about your privacy. This is why we think with privacy in mind when adding any feature to our platform. In order to provide you our services, we need to store some basic information about your account.

## What kind of information is being stored?

We must store some information to provide you with our services. The amount of information depends on what you decide to post on our platform. All crucial information like your password are stored securely in such a way nobody including us can retrieve it.

### Your username, e-mail address, IP address and password

This platform stores your username(s), e-mail address(es) IP address and password(s) to store your account. Without this information, we can not provide you our services. Below is outlined exactly why this information is stored:

Usernames - Usernames are (often made up) aliases stored to identify one another on our platform. This information is required to login and find other users on both our website and game and is displayed on user profiles.\
E-mail address - E-mail addresses are stored for both security reasons and your convenience. We request you to verify your e-mail address immediately after you create your account so we can verify you are a legitimate human being trying to use our website. Your e-mail address can also be used to retrieve your account when you forget your password using the reset password by e-mail address functionality that we provide.\
IP addresses - IP addresses are stored for security and moderation purposes. Using your IP address, we are able to detect if you are really you using your own account and to find any violations of our terms of services within our platform. We reserve the right to block your IP address from our platform at any time for any reason.\
Passwords - Passwords are stored to secure our user accounts with a secret word and/or a combination of numbers. Your passwords are stored securely within our database server in such way that nobody including us, can retrieve your password. Without passwords, users can not access their account securely.

### Content voluntarily posted by our users

We store user generated content posted voluntarily by our users (tickets) to provide our users with immediate and effective support. This content may include tickets created by you or unwanted user information. We highly encourage our users to never post any personal content. If you want your information removed because you (accidentally) posted such information, please open a ticket for assistance.

### Details relating to account sessions

For the convenience of our users, details are being stored when you login into any account. Owners of these accounts can see details of these sessions to make sure if their accounts are still safe. This information can not be seen by anyone other than the account owners. The information that we store in these cases are outlined below:

User agents - This is a string of characters that can tell websites like ours what browser someone is using, and what OS (Operation System) someone is using\
Country codes - This is being stored so users can easily make sure if someone else is on their account or if they left a session running. More often than not, this makes the process of making sure nobody else is in their account(s) a lot easier\
Last used timestamp - This contains the time when the session in question was used for the last time\
Is this information being sold to anyone?

We do not sell any user information to anyone. User privacy is our highest priority and we will never compromise your trust with us by selling your information to third party companies.

Some information is being shared with Google. By using our website, you agree to share some basic details with Google for the security of our users. The information that is being shared with Google is outlined below:
