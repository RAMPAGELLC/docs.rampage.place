# Acceptable Use Policy

## RAMPAGE Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

This Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) is an essential component of the RAMPAGE Server Rental Agreement and is mandatory for all our subscribers, regardless of the type of server they rent.

By utilizing the RAMPAGE Cloud Services, subscribers implicitly accept and agree to adhere to the RAMPAGE.Host AUP as well as the Terms of Service (TOS).

We advocate for the unfiltered exchange of information and ideas on the Internet and generally do not actively monitor subscriber activities under normal circumstances. Additionally, we do not exercise editorial control over the content of websites, email transmissions, newsgroups, or other materials accessed through our services, except for specific proprietary websites. However, per our Terms of Service, we reserve the right to remove any materials that, at our discretion, may be illegal, pose a liability risk, or violate this AUP. RAMPAGE may collaborate with legal authorities and third parties in investigating suspected or alleged criminal or civil wrongdoing. Violating this AUP may result in the suspension or immediate termination of a RAMPAGE.Host (and/or) RAMPAGE ID account or other appropriate actions.

## Guidelines for establishing and enforcing the AUP include:

1. Ensure reliable service for our subscribers.
2. Ensure the security and privacy of our systems and network, as well as those of others.
3. Comply with the existing laws of the Province of Ontario and Canada.
4. Maintain our reputation as a responsible service provider.
5. Encourage responsible Internet use and discourage activities that diminish the usability and value of Internet services.
6. Preserve the value of Internet resources as a platform for free expression and information exchange.
7. Preserve the privacy and security of individual users.

If a account is used to violate the AUP or our TOS, we reserve the right to terminate the service without notice. While we prefer to advise customers on inappropriate behavior and recommend corrective action, blatant violations of the AUP may lead to immediate service termination. Our failure to enforce this policy, for any reason, shall not be considered a waiver of our right to do so at any time.

As a member of our network community, users must exercise their Internet access responsibly. For any questions regarding this policy, please contact us at [support@rampage.host](mailto:support@rampage.host).

## Security

Subscribers are responsible for any misuse of their accounts and must take steps to prevent unauthorized access. Subscribers should not use their accounts to breach security of another account or attempt unauthorized access to another network or server.

## Accountability

Subscribers will be held responsible for any third-party activity using their account that violates AUP guidelines.

RAMPAGE.Host reserves the right to suspend network access for any customer if their server is the source or target of AUP violations or for other reasons chosen by RAMPAGE.Host. In case of inappropriate activity detection, the subscriber's accounts may be deactivated until an investigation is complete, with prior notification not assured.

Users violating systems or network security may face criminal or civil liability. RAMPAGE.Host will fully cooperate with investigations of security violations at other sites, including collaborating with law enforcement authorities.

## Reporting Violations of AUP

RAMPAGE.Host requests anyone suspecting a violation to direct information to [https://abuse.rampage.host](https://abuse.rampage.host).

RAMPAGE.Host may take various actions in response to complaints, including issuing warnings, suspending newsgroup posting privileges, suspending or terminating accounts, billing for administrative costs, and initiating legal action.

## Revisions to This AUP

RAMPAGE.Host reserves the right to revise, amend, or modify this AUP, our TOS, and other policies and agreements at any time. Notice of any changes will be emailed to each subscriber at the provided email address.

The subscriber acknowledges reading and agreeing to this Acceptable Use Policy.
