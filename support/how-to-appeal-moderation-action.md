# How to appeal moderation action

If you believe that you have been wrongly moderated on the RAMPAGE Interactive's Discords or games, you can appeal the decision by opening a ticket on support.rampage.place.

Here's how to do it:

1. Go to support.rampage.place and click on "Submit a Ticket." You'll be prompted to provide your name, email address, and a brief description of the issue. Be sure to explain if its "Discord Moderation" or "In-game Moderation", depending on where the moderation took place.
2. Provide as much detail as possible in your ticket. Explain why you believe you were wrongly moderated and provide any evidence you have to support your claim. This could include screenshots, chat logs, or video footage. The more information you provide, the better chance you have of having the moderation removed.
3. Be patient. It may take some time for the RAMPAGE Interactive support team to review your ticket and make a decision. If your appeal is successful, the moderation will be removed and you will be able to continue using the server or playing the game without any restrictions.
4. Remember that the RAMPAGE Interactive has rules and guidelines that must be followed at all times. While it's possible that a mistake was made in your moderation, it's also possible that you violated one of these rules. Be respectful and honest in your appeal and provide any evidence that supports your case.

In summary, to appeal Discord or in-game moderation, open a ticket on support.rampage.place and provide as much detail and evidence as possible. Be patient while the RAMPAGE Interactive support team reviews your ticket and remember to follow the server's rules and guidelines in the future.
